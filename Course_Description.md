This course aims to enable students to learn the fundamentals of digital design, comprehend the design 
principles of computer architecture, and implement a simple microprocessor. Students will learn digital 
logic, gates, and combinational and sequential building blocks in hardware description language (HDL), as 
well as advanced topics in computer architecture. 

Student Learning Outcomes:
1. Understand the fundamentals of digital design
2. Comprehend the basic principles of modern computer architecture
3. Learn how modern microprocessors work from bottom up
4. Apply the design principles in the implementation of a simple microprocessor
5. Test and debug the design systematically
6. Manage the design complexity of microprocessors
